## Development Guidelines

### How to edit code locally?

You can choose [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) or any IDE you prefer. The only requirement is to have Node.js and npm installed.

### Environment Requirements

```
# Node.js ≥ 20
# npm ≥ 10
Example:
# node -v   # v20.18.3
# npm -v    # 10.8.2
```

### Installing Node.js on Windows

```
# Step 1: Visit the Node.js official website: https://nodejs.org/, click download. The website will automatically suggest a suitable version (32-bit or 64-bit) for your system.
# Step 2: Run the installer: Double-click the downloaded installer to run it.
# Step 3: Complete the installation: Follow the installation wizard to complete the process.
# Step 4: Verify installation: Open Command Prompt (cmd) or your IDE terminal, and type `node -v` and `npm -v` to check if Node.js and npm are installed correctly.
```

### Installing Node.js on macOS

```
# Step 1: Using Homebrew (Recommended method): Open Terminal. Type the command `brew install node` and press Enter. If Homebrew is not installed, you need to install it first by running the following command in Terminal:
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
Alternatively, use the official installer: Visit the Node.js official website. Download the macOS .pkg installer. Open the downloaded .pkg file and follow the prompts to complete the installation.
# Step 2: Verify installation: Open Command Prompt (cmd) or your IDE terminal, and type `node -v` and `npm -v` to check if Node.js and npm are installed correctly.
```

### After installation, follow these steps:

```
# Step 1: Download the code package
# Step 2: Extract the code package
# Step 3: Open the code package with your IDE and navigate into the code directory
